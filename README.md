# Evapotranspiration GUI

A work in progress, using [HumbleUI](https://github.com/HumbleUI/HumbleUI) and Clojure 
based on the works of [lilactown/humble-starter](https://github.com/lilactown/humble-starter).

<div align="center">
    <img src=img/progress.png style="border-radius: 8px; width: 40%">
</div>

## Development

To simply run the app, execute `./script/run.sh`.

To build a JAR, you can run `./script/build.sh`.

## Platform support

Thanks to the efforts of the HumbleUI team, this app can run on Windows, macOS and \*nix systems
with X and Wayland windowing systems (as long as a JRE 15 or greater is installed)

## Credit

A lot of this code was copied and then modified from the HumbleUI codebase
itself, as well as humble-starter as a base.
