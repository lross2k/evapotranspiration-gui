# Evapotranspiration GUI

A work in progress, using [HumbleUI](https://github.com/HumbleUI/HumbleUI) and Clojure 
based on the works of [lilactown/humble-starter](https://github.com/lilactown/humble-starter).

## Development

To simply run the app, execute `./script/run.sh`.

To build a JAR, you can run `./script/build.sh`.

## Credit

A lot of this code was copied and then modified from the HumbleUI codebase
itself, as well as humble-starter as a base.
